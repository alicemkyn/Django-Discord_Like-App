# Django-Discord_Like-App
Python Django | Discord-Like App | PostgreSQL <br>
I started to build an webapp similar to Discord with Python & Django Framework.The default database has been changed from Sqlite3 to PostgreSQL.
And created environment variables to keep the sensitive data in settings.py.If anyone want to improve this project or use it for your other projects, ask
me the environment variable file which hold all the data about secret key and database information.
